Upload polygon packages without headaches

Command-line tool for [polygon](https://polygon.codeforces.com/).

## Supported features

* Everything that [polygin-cli](https://github.com/kunyavskiy/polygon-cli) can do.
* Upload package to polygon.codeforces.com with groups, points, and dependencies. 
* Rewrite new scoring for the task. pdf reader detects scoring table or your own scoring.

## TODO

Add auto-create new task in polygon with a new id, auto-commit at polygon, and build package.

Support another language.

## Motivation

Unfortunately, the usual polygon-cli does not know how to assign points for groups.
